## Project 3: Use a lib (jQuery) to access and digest a RESTful service
### RIT - 4002-536 Web Client Side Programming, Fall 2012

I've open-sourced my project 3 submission for future students to reference as an example. This application pulls data from RIT's RESTful server and displays/organizes the data for the end user.

#### DEMO
Nope. This project is dependent on RIT's REST server + relevant database. View [RIT_BackendDocumentation.html](https://github.com/matthewtraughber/4002-536_project-3/blob/master/RIT_BackendDocumentation.html) for more detailed information.
